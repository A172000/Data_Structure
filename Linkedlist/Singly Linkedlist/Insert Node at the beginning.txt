/* This function is in LinkedList class. Inserts a
new Node at front of the list. This method is
defined inside LinkedList class shown above */

public void push(int data)
{
	/* 1 & 2: Allocate the Node &
			Put in the data*/
	Node newNode = new Node(new_data);

	/* 3. Make next of new Node as head */

	/* 4. Move the head to point to new Node */
	head = new_node;
}
Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(1), We have a pointer to the head and we can directly attach a node and change the pointer. So the Time complexity of inserting a node at the head position is O(1) as it does a constant amount of work.
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
